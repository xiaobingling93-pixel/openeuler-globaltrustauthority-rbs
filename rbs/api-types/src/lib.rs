//! `OpenAPI` `components.schemas` for HTTP JSON bodies live under [`openapi`] as [`utoipa::ToSchema`]
//! types. The checked-in [`docs/proto/rbs_rest_api.yaml`](../../../docs/proto/rbs_rest_api.yaml) is emitted when

//! **Module layout:** map OpenAPI tag names to `openapi/<snake_case>/` and nest files for related
//! schemas (e.g. System-tagged version metadata → `openapi/system/version.rs`). Crate root
//! re-exports schema types for convenience.
